## Approach for Authentication

Summary of This Approach:

	•	Frontend:
	•	The user registers with email and password using Firebase.
	•	After registration, Firebase provides the ID token (JWT).
	•	The frontend sends the ID token and username to the backend for storage.
	•	Backend:
	•	The backend verifies the Firebase ID token to authenticate the user.
	•	The backend stores the username and firebaseUid but does not store the email.
	•	Firebase manages the email securely and ensures its uniqueness.

Why This is a Good Approach:

	1.	Email Management: Firebase manages email-related concerns such as uniqueness, verification, and password recovery. Your backend doesn’t need to worry about email at all.
	2.	Security: Since you don’t store the email in your backend, you reduce the exposure of sensitive information in your database. The email is stored and managed by Firebase, which is a secure service for handling user authentication.
	3.	Simpler Backend: The backend only needs to handle the username and firebaseUid, reducing the complexity and scope of your backend user management.
	4.	Firebase Authentication: By leveraging Firebase’s authentication system, you can offload the security concerns related to password management, token verification, and user authentication to Firebase, which is optimized for this purpose.
	5.	Flexibility: If you later want to add additional authentication methods (Google, Facebook, etc.), Firebase handles these seamlessly, and your backend remains focused on non-authentication logic.

Potential Drawback:

The main trade-off is that your backend will be somewhat dependent on Firebase for user authentication and email management.
